# Spring Boot MongoDB Sandbox Collections
A Collection of JSONs to test the MongoDB sandbox.

Use the "Person_<number>.json" to method save and "Persons_<number>.json" to method save all.
The find, update and delete methods can only be used with the UUID generateds in the moment of saving, that's why I didn't created them here.
But you can just copy the UUID generated with the Post to find all and them insert a "id": "<UUID>" field with a comma on the the first position of each JSON objects.

The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/NachoNardo/SpringBootMongoDBSandbox).
